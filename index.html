            <p id="introduction">Hello my name is Daniel and I live in Monterrey, Mexico. I consider myself a very friendly person. 
                I really like computing and from a very young age I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to programming.
                In my free time I play video games, although now with work and studies I have not been able to be very active online.
                Another of my hobbies is reading books based on real success stories. They help me get inspired and learn about the 
                principles that have helped people achieve their goals. My dream has always been to become the best version of myself 
                to inspire others to become the best version of themselves.</p>

            <p>people here enjoy meeting with friends every weekend, climbing a mountain, watching football soccer, and preparing some BBQ. Monterrey is the city with the best economy 
                in Mexico in 2024.</p>
